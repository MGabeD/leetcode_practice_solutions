Doing A Random Leetcode Question Every Day

Pushing at least a solution a day to keep myself accountable outside of coding for work. Trying to keep sharp on interview skills

The reason I am doing this is to be accountable to myself and to have a clear process for recording my problems and
how I think I can fix or improve them as I go on. Getting back up to speed on leetcode should not be too hard but
having the self-analysis forced on myself by pushing it should make this easier as I will have to reflect.
